# 2013 Boston University QuantitativeImmunology
I earned a scholarship to attend the 2013 Summer School on Quantitative Systems Immunology, Boston University. All data will be uploaded here

# About:
This educational program, held at BU (10-14 June 2013), was intended for trainees in the biological sciences who wanted to explore the use of mathematics, statistics, and computation in their own research but may not have experience in the quantitative sciences. In total, out of the 92 received applications, 52 were accepted, and 26 scholarships were awarded, which covered travel and housing costs.

The course began with a day of foundations in mathematical modeling and statistics. During each day thereafter, there were lectures in the morning and corresponding practical exercises in the afternoon. Topics included phylogenetics and molecular evolution of viruses and antibodies, network and pathway analysis, biochemical reaction modeling, population-dynamic modeling, biomedical ontologies, and more.
